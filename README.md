# Budibase Feedback

This project holds the content of the feedback popover, displaye in the Budibase builder.

This is hosted at `https://feedback.budibase.com`. 

We host this seperately so that we can change the content of this, without making a new release of the Budibase builder


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
